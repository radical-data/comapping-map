        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>What is Comapping Amelisweerd?</h3>
        <p>
          Comapping Amelisweerd looks at what mapping looks like when it is done
          from below, by the people who use and live in a space.
        </p>
        <h3>How can I participate?</h3>
        <p>
          By submitting 'data points' of pictures, audio, text or even walk
          routes, visitors to Amelisweerd fill up the online platform at
          comapping.org. These data points can focus on anything from where
          certain trees are to thoughts linked to different areas to just
          documenting everything yellow.
        </p>
        <p>
          These points are shown at comapping.org, which brings these community
          observations together to explore interactively.
        </p>
        <p>
          The piece will grow as the Gardening program progresses. Visitors can
          submit by themselves or in one of the datawalks organised by Creative
          Coding Utrecht.
        </p>
        <h3>Who created this?</h3>
        <p>
